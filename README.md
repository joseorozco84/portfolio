## Requirements:

Before getting started, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation:

First, you need to download the project files to your computer. Open the terminal and run these commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
```
```bash
cd your-project
```
   
A virtual environment is like an isolated space where we'll install the project's dependencies. This is optional but highly recommended. Run these commands based on your operating system:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

* Unix:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the project's dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Initialize the Reflex project:

Now, let's set up the Reflex project. Run the following command:
```bash
reflex init
```

## Running the Application
Once you've installed the dependencies and configured the project, you can run the web application with the following command:

```bash
reflex run
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the web page at http://localhost:3000/home in your browser.
